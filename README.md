# Kibana-Network-Visualization
This script will install the KBN Network Visualization Plugin Developed by David Moreno Lumbreras in Security Onion.  I have included the JAVA binaries in the Tar.gz file.

This plugin has been tested in Security Onion Version 16.04.4.1 and 14.04.5.13

Once the script has been executed.  The Network plugin will be available at the bottem of the New Visualization page in Kibana.

Note: Adding third party plugins to Kibana can increase the time it take for the Kibana Docker Container to fully initialize.

For issues related to the plugin itself or documentation on how to configure the plugin refer to David's Github page.
